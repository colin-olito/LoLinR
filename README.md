# Local Linear Regression for Estmating Monotonic Biological Rates in R (LoLinR)


## Documentation

We introduce the `LoLinR` package, which provides tools to implement local linear regression techniques for estimating monotonic rates from time-series or trace data in a statistically robust and reproducable fashion. The methods are a modification of traditional Loess regression techniques built around the wrapper function `findLocLin()`. 

See the package documentation for `LoLinR` using `library(help=LoLinR)` and examples therin.


## Installation

**Using `devtools::install_github`**

(install `devtools` with `install.packages("devtools")`)

The `LoLinR` package can be installed from github using the [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package. `LoLinR` does not currently have any dependencies on other packages
